# Affordable Reflectance Transformation Imaging Dome

Author : Leszek Pawlowicz

Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) creates a computerized virtual lighting model of an object's surface using multiple photos taken at different lighting angles. It reveals subtle surface details difficult or impossible to see without complicated & expensive techniques. It's used in archaeology, paleontology, forensics, numismatics, and any other field where you're interested in seeing enhanced surface details. Custom-made automated systems are available, but cost tens of thousands of dollars. The technique can be done manually, but it's tedious and time-consuming. My system is fully automated, and can be put together for less than about $600 (plus camera), making it affordable for schools, museums and individuals.

All plans for building this system will be released under the Open Hardware standard, and these build instructions are licensed under Creative Commons. All software needed to run the system will be released as Open Source, GPL version 2.0.

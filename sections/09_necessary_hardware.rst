Simple Stand
------------

While there are ways you could use the RTI dome by lifting it up and placing it over the object you want to photograph, it makes more sense to have the dome/camera stationary, and have a way to easily swap multiple objects in and out of the system for easy data acquisition. One solution is put the dome on an elevated stand, and I’ll first be describing the simplest possible stand design I can think of. 

There are reasons you might want to modify this setup having to do with how you mount the camera, and I’ll talk about that in the next step. But even there, these instructions will help you with that process. There’s a more advanced/flexible stand design that will be described later.

Grab a wooden dowel about 1” or so in diameter, preferably a soft wood like pine. Cut it into 4 6” long segments for the stand legs:
